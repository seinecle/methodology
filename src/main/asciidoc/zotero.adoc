== Why is Zotero useful for a thesis? Saving you from a nightmare.
When you are finished writing your dissertation, a last touch consists in adding **a list of the articles**, books, etc. that you have cited in your dissertation.

//+
This list of articles, books, etc. is called a **bibliography** and it should follow a series of rules:

//+
- it should include _all_ the references that you have cited in your document.
- the list should be sorted alphabetically by the name of the author of the reference.
- each reference should include the title of the article (or book...), the names of all authors, the name of the journal, the date of publication, etc.

**A very common and sad situation is to find students wasting hours and nights to finish up their bibliography, when actually Zotero helps you do it automatically.** 

//+
Zotero helps you:

1. keep and organize a list of your references
2. insert these references in the text of the dissertation
3. create automatically a bibliography at the end of the document, containing all the references cited in the text of the thesis.

Then, a red search bar opens.
Type the first words of the title of the article you want to insert, or the name of the author:
