== Short description
Content analysis consists in collecting documents and getting insights from them by applying a systematic categorization scheme to them. The results obtained can help the analyst create a model, formulate hypotheses, and create interpretative narratives.

== Key steps
- selecting which documents to collect. These can be interviews, notes from an ethnography, press articles, social media content... it matters that the type of source and the rules that define which source to be collected, are defined in coherence with the research question.
- defining a categorization scheme
//+
- collecting documents then coding them, or collecting them AND coding them at the same time.
- iterating on the coding scheme while the collection proceeds, or after it.
- synthetizing results (eg, in a table) and iterating on the coding scheme as needed.
